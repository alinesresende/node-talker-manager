In this case, information from a MySQL database was used to return the list of speakers!

<details>
  <summary>About the MySQL database: </summary><br />

The `docker-compose.yaml` file has one more service called `db` with a MySQL instance configured to use port `3306`.

</details>

When created, the `db` service creates and populates the `talkers` table, which contains the same data as the `talker.json` file, in the following format:

| id | name                 | age | talk_watched_at | talk_rate |
|----|----------------------|-----|-----------------|-----------|
| 1  | Henrique Albuquerque | 62  | 23/10/2020      | 5         |
| 2  | Helo√≠sa Albuquerque  | 67  | 23/10/2020      | 5         |
| 3  | Ricardo Xavier Filho | 33  | 23/10/2020      | 5         |
